# CloudSQL
The Cloud SQL Explorer provides access Cloud SQL instances.

## Listing and Viewing Cloud SQL Instances
The Cloud SQL Explorer allows for the listing of Cloud SQL (MySQL) instances for the current Cloud project.
Each instance exposes many of its attributes in the Properties Explorer, such as its current state, IP address and more.

## Connecting to a Cloud SQL instances
The Cloud SQL instance's database can be connected to and added as a Data Connection (to the Server Explorer) via the
instance's context menu.  If the current environment doesn't have MySQL for Visual Studio install (required to add a
MySQL Database as a Data Connection) the user will be prompted to install it.
